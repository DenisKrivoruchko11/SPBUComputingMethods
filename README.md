# Image Processing Application

## Introduction

The Image Processing Application is a sophisticated tool designed for efficient image manipulation and analysis. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for applying various image filters, comparing results, and processing images in bulk. Built with Python and leveraging the PyQt5 framework, this application is suitable for both academic and practical applications in image processing.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive navigation for selecting images and applying filters.
- **Image Filtering**: Apply a variety of matrix filters to enhance or modify images.
- **Dual Image Comparison**: View original and filtered images side by side for easy comparison.
- **Batch Processing**: Select a folder of images to apply filters in bulk, with results saved to a specified directory.
- **Performance Analysis**: Generate reports on the performance of different filtering algorithms.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python3 -m src.main.run
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Choose to work with a single image or a directory of images.
3. Select an image or folder, and apply the desired filters.
4. View the results and save the processed images as needed.

## Future Work

This project serves as a foundation for further development in image processing. Future enhancements may include:

- Integration of more advanced filters and image processing techniques.
- Improved user interface for better usability.
- Support for additional image formats.
- Enhanced performance metrics and reporting features.
